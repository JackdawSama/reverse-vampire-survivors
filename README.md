# Were-wolf Victims
Were-wolf Victims is my thesis project which I worked on during the last two semesters during my time at NYU - Tisch's Game Center.

## Overview
Were-wolf victims is a a Shoot-em' Up/Bullet Hell but with a tiny spin. It is a radial Bullet Hell where the player rotates around the boss and dodges and weaves around it. What's more is that this is a project that was built for an arcade machine and was run on one during NYU Game Center's Annual Showcase.

## Tech Stack
- Game Engine - Unity 2D
- Pixel Art Editor - Aseprite
- Language - C#
- Patterns Used - Finite State Machines, Hierarchical Finite State Machine, Object Pooling, Scriptable Objects
- Controller - IPAC2 Rotary Dial and 4 Buttons mapped to Mouse and Keyboard using WinIPAC GUI.

## Narrative
The werewolf is out for revenge. He is enraged by the existence of the Moon and blames it for all its actions. He feels no remorse for all the lives it has taken and blames the Moon for his bloodthirsty actions. In his denial and unwillingness to embrace his life as a werewolf, he decides to destroy the Moon once and for all so that he could retain his humanity and never again turn into a werewolf.

Dodge and weave as the Moon and slowly wear off the werewolf and take him down with the help of the souls that wander who were his victims.
